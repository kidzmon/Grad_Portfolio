CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old gentleman with a past history of right middle cerebral artery
infarct, left hemiparesis. The patient presented with one week of headache, temperature of 103
and right-sided shaking of which the patient was aware. Right arm and face were shaking.
MEDICATIONS: ASA, Baclofen, Coreg.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG, Photic stimulation was completed.
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is lower voltage,
diffusely slow with a 6 Hz to 7 Hz alpha rhythm. In addition, there is an area of 3 Hz delta in the
right occipital region. This sometimes disrupts the alpha rhythm on the right There is also some
subtle, more slower delta in that region. As the patient becomes drowsy, more sharply
contoured slowing Is noted. right frontal and then right posterior temporal. As the patient
transitions in and out of a drowsy state. the alpha rhythm is much more vigorous on the left as
compared to the right and significantly higher amplitude. Photic stimulation elicits a driving
response bilaterally at faster frequencies.
HR: 50bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Disrupted alpha on the right
3. Occasional sharply contoured slowing, particularly in the right mid temporal region in
drowsiness.
This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as
well as a structural or functional abnormality on the right. This sharply contoured slowing raises
the possibility of a focal mechanism for seizures.
