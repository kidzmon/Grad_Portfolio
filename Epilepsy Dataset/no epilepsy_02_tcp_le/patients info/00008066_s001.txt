CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old woman with renal failure, diabetes, right amputation now with foot infection, headache, and confusion. Last time of dialysis on the 25th.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake but
somewhat confused. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a disorganized
pattern with rhythmic theta, bursts of frontally predominant beta. As the patient transitions towards drowsiness, there are bursts of beta activity noted in the central regions. Occasional shifting arrhythmic delta activity is observed. With eye opening, lambda waves are observed. Features of drowsiness include an increase in slowing. Photic stimulation was performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep, but there is a scant driving response.
HR: 66 to 90 bpm
Abnormal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. FIRDA.
3. Rare triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are nonspecific but are
most compatible with a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. No epileptiform features are observed.
