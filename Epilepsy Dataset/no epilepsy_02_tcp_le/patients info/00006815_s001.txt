CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old woman admitted on 7/27/2010, with hepatic encephalopathy.

MEDICATIONS: Ceftriaxone, Albuterol, Rifampin, Rifaximin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.


DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a pattern with rhythmic theta and delta frequency activity. There are a handful of triphasic waves and although much of the background includes rhythmic, 3 Hz to 5 Hz activity, there is some faster theta frequency activity noted particularly in the frontal regions. Even as the patient is drifting off to sleep, she tends to tense up her muscles producing artifact in the background. There are also a handful of posteriorly predominant periodic complexes picked up particularly around the time of photic stimulation. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR: 96 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.
2. Occasional triphasic waves.
3. Some posteriorly predominant, somewhat periodic complexes which may represent a variant of a triphasic wave but may also be a more typical periodic complex.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. This complex pattern is most supportive of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. The posteriorly predominant periodic complexes do suggest a tendency toward seizures. As the patient's mental status and hepatic failure improve, additional recording may be indicated.
