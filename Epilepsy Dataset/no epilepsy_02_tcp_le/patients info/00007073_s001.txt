CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old female with right temporal intracranial hemorrhage, past history of stroke, chronic anticoagulation, IVC filter, and asthma.

MEDICATIONS: Hydralazine, Amiodipine Zocor, Insulin, Isosorbide, Protonix, Zofran, Midazolam, Nicardipine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake through stage II sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is occasional frontal delta. Prominent stage II sleep is obscured. On occasion in stage II sleep there are bursts of slower, lower voltage arrhythmic delta, followed by asymmetric spindles. Spindles tend to be higher amplitude and more vigorous in the right frontocentral region compared to the left. The delta is again in that same area, right frontocentral region.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due.to:
1. Asymmetric spindles, better represented on the right than the left.
2. Occasional frontal delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The waking record has a bit more muscle artifact identified on the right than the left. Consequently, more subtle features such as disruption of the alpha rhythm are harder to identify. No epileptiform features were noted.
