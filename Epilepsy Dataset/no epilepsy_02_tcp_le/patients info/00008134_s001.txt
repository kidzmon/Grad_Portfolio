REASON FOR STUDY:
Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:
A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10/20 electrode system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes. No activation procedures were performed except stimulation.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:
None.
MEDICATIONS:
Ampicillin, insulin and Norvasc.
MEDICAL HISTORY:
An 86-year-old man with a past medical history of COPD, CVA, diabetes, hypertension and AFib who presents with shaking continuous for about 45 minutes, unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The record opens up to a diffusely slow low-amplitude recording with no posterior dominant rhythm and no clear frontal central beta seen. No normal sleep architecture is seen. No activation procedures were performed. During the recording, stimulation with noxious pressure on the feet is performed with no clear change in the reactivity of the EEG.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to diffuse slow waves, severe.
CLINICAL CORRELATION;
This EEG reveals evidence of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology. In this patient, it may be due to medication effect. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
