CLINICAL HISTORY:
A 59-year-old lady with chief complaint of syncope. The patient does not remember the event. Has a past history of HIV, depression, asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and anxiety.
MEDICATIONS:
Alprazolam, Morphine, tramadol, Truvada, Lip1tor, and others.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
This is an awake and drowsy record In wakefulness, there is low voltage alpha bilaterally. There is lot of beta activity throughout the records, which may be contributed to the benzodiazepines the patient is on. Drowsiness is characterized by slower rolling eye movements. The hyperventilation brings about high amplitude changes. Occasionally, there is central mu and there is also head rocking seen on and off. There were no epileptiform features noted.
Heart rate 50-55 bpm
IMPRESSION:
Normal EEG with low-voltage alpha and lot of beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
A normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. If epilepsy is a clinical consideration, please consider sleep-deprived EEG or EEG recording of longer duration to capture epileptiform activity.
ATTESTATION STATEMENT FOR THE EEG LAB:
