CLINICAL HISTORY:  41 year old male with past medical history of substance abuse who is status post code lasting for about 14 minutes now with neuro versus sacral oblique movements.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Norepinephrine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal electrodes and of EKG electrodes.  The patient was comatose during the exam.  No activating procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens up to a low amplitude frequency with diffusely slow frequency background with superimposed muscle artifact which limits the interpretation of the recording.  During the recording, the patient on the video appears to open his mouth as part of the breathing movements with the ventilator.  There is no abnormal correlation with the discharge with these movements.  No sleep architecture is sleep.  No abnormal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.  When the patient is stimulated by the technician, there is mild increase in muscle artifact but no change in the background frequencies.
HR:    N/A
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Excessive muscle artifact, ventilation artifact during the recording.
SEIZURES:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Abnormal discharges.
Generalized slow waves.
Low amplitude recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to diffuse slow waves and low voltage.  However, it is limited by increased muscle artifact and artifact from the ventilator.  No overt seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
