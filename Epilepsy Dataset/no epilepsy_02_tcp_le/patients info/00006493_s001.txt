CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old woman with embolic stroke, waxing and waning language function and cramps in the right hand.
MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Plavix, Avandia, Motrin, Prozac
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is somewhat drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. In this individual with significant ischemic white matter disease, there is more disruption of faster frequency in the right hemisphere compared to the left, particularly in the right posterior regions. FIRDA is observed as she drifts off to sleep, followed by spindles.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background disorganization.
2. Shifting slow waves particularly in the posterior region.
3. Focal slowing a bit more prominent in the right posterior region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal slowing is a bit more prominent in the right posterior region than the left. These findings may be correlated with imaging, but given the presence of the bilateral changes, the ischemic changes on the right basically produce a greater electrographic signature.
