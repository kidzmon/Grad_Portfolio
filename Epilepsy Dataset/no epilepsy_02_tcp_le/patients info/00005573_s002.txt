CLINICAL HISTORY:  81 year old woman with syncope, M.l., hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:   Aggrenox, Zetia, Meclizine, Risperidone, Nifedical, isosorbide, Propoxyphene, Flovent, Nitroglycerine, Calcium, Glucosamine

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is posterior dominant rhythm which reaches 9 Hz, there are intermittent bursts of arrhythmic delta activity which demonstrates shifting slowing in the right or left hemisphere, particularly in the temporal regions. In relaxed wakefulness, there is a small amount of excess theta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 	84 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Mildly  due to:
1. 	Mild background slowing and disorganization.



CLINICAL CORR ELATION:


No epileptiform features are seen. In an individual of this


age, these findings are nonspecific and can be due to many different causes including a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, underlying dementia, or ischemic white matter disease. There are no epileptiform features but the first stages of sleep were not captured.
