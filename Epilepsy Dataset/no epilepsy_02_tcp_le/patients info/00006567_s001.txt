CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old male with HIV and spells characterized by eye twitching and mouth movements. Past history of an intracerebral hemorrhage last week, drug abuse and HIV disease.
MEDICATIONS: Mephyton, Truvada, Methadone,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with rhythmic theta frequency activity of 6-7 Hertz. The patient is resting comfortably but as he drifts off to sleep he seems to be "mouth breathing" with a little bit of muscle artifact in the right temporalis region. Vertex waves are observed in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 60 bpm.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The background slowing described above is nonspecific and can be seen in diffuse disturbance of cerebral function due to many different causes. If epilepsy is an important consideration a repeat tracing may be of use.
