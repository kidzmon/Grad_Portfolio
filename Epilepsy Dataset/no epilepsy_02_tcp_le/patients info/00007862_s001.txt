Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of
EKG. There was no hyperventilation or photic stimulation performed.
DESCRIPTION RECORDS:
In wakefulness, there is a 7-9 Hz alpha rhythm. There are intermittent bursts of rhythmic, acute paroxysmal delta. There is
mild, shifting asymmetry. Head rocking artifact is noted in the occipital regions. The patient is awake, wearing a facemask.
As the recording continues and she becomes drowsy there, intermittent bursts of shifting delta from either hemisphere.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
