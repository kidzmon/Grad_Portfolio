CLINICAL HISTORY: 77 year old with encephalopathy, left frontal and right parietal occipital infarcts.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Glucagon, Zofran, isosorbide, Metoprolol, Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
completed
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall EEG is relatively low voltage. The
patient is generally drowsy, but there is a glimpse of a 9 hertz alpha rhythm more commonly seen from the left hemisphere than the right hemisphere. In addition, intermittent, focal slow characterized by delta is noted in the occipital region, right greater than left. Features of drowsiness included increase in background slowing. The patient is somewhat agitated and moving about during the EEG. Photic stimulation is complicated by the patient's inattentiveness and movement, but does not activate the record. Intermittent bursts of frontally predominant slow generalized delta are noted.
HR: 100 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Right occipital focal slowing.
3. FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are compatible with the past
toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. The focal features are congruent with the past history of stroke. No epileptiform features are noted.
