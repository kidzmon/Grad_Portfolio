CLINICAL HISTORY:	81 year old woman with dizziness, feeling as if she is going to pass out, hypertension and an Ml many years ago. Evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea or syncope.

MEDICATIONS:  Nifedipine, Zetia, Lovenox, ASA, Flovent, Propoxyphene, Esomeprazole, Dipyridamole

INTRODUCTION:  DIGITAL:  Video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  There is no hyperventilation, but photic stimulation is completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is reasonably organized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz, but occasional background theta.
In addition, there are brief bursts of mixed theta and delta slowing with a small amount
of low voltage frontal central beta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing and a handful of vertex waves. Photic stimulation elicits:  Scant Driving response.

HR:   90 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Mild disorganization and slowing of the alpha rhythm for age.
2. 	Occasional bursts of shifting slowing.
3. 	Occasional bursts of generalized slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in the context of several pathologies in this age group, including underlying cerebrovascular disease. No epileptiform features are identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, additional studies are advised.
