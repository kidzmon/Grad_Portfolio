CLINICAL HISTORY: 78 year old male admitted on 7/14/2010, for burns with a complicated hospital stay including non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, PCI on 7/18/2010, now with facial droop, vomiting, right-sided weakness, right carotid stent. Evaluate for encephalopathy.

MEDICATIONS: Pantoprazole, Heparin, Zofran, Insulin, Zocor, ASA, Plavix, Moxifloxacin, Linezolid, Lopressor

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient appears to be very tense. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Most of the EEG is obscured by muscle or movement artifact, but in the brief sections that are not, there seems to be excessive beta and theta. There is no mention as to whether or not the patient had injured his scalp which could contribute to the problem. No later sections of the record include a pattern with slow theta.

HR: 108 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific but can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study when the patient is a bit more comfortable is suggested.
