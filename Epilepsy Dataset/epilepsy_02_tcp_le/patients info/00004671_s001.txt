CLINICAL HISTORY: 22-year-old gentleman with mitochondrial disease, daily
seizures, some brief, some more remarkable, dysphagia and cardiac abnormalities.
MEDICATIONS: Seroquel, Norvasc, Klonopin, Depakote, Topiramate, Felbamate
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation of
photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record demonstrates a low voltage,
relatively featureless pattern with theta and beta. Intermittent muscle artifact is
observed. The individual has a vagus nerve stimulator which has been turned off. There
is no VNS artifact, but there is muscle artifact picked up at the T3 electrode. Features of
stage 1 sleep include vertex waves followed by arousals. Brief stage 2 sleep includes
vertex wave spindles again followed by arousals.
70 to 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Arousal low voltage, featureless record when awake although at times, there is a
suggestion of an alpha rhythm.
CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded today. There were no
definitive epileptiform features.
