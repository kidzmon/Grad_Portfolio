CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old male, status post cardiac arrest treat d with hypothermia May 17, 2011 with prolonged delirium.
MEDICATIONS: Protonix, Labetalol, Meropenem. ASA, Plavix, Digoxin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has had a recent tracheostomy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a amplitude, theta frequency pattern, with a glimpse of a 7 Hz posterior do rhythm.
There is slow rolling eye movement artifact. Wicket activity is picked up of the right with an alerting response, additional eye movement, alpha and theta frequency activity is noted. Wicket activity is later identified on the left.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Moderate background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to a previous study, May 20, this
EEG continues to demonstrate a slow background. Although there has little improvement, this EEG is perhaps slightly slower than the previous study the fact that the patient is postoperative following the PEG may be a contributing r. This EEG clearly demonstrates wicket, which might have explained the isolated unexpected sharp waves seen in the first study.
