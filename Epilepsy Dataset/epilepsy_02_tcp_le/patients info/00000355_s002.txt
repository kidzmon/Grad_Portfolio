HISTORY: 41 year old right handed male with epilepsy previously on
Keppra and Tegretol but switched to Tegretol monotherapy, now has episodes of
headaches and spacing out.
MEDICATIONS: Lovenox, Protonix, Tegretol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-defined 9 Hz
posterior dominant rhythm. The maximal waking record is relatively well-defined. There.
are occasional bursts of paroxysmal slowing, and in some of these, there is a left
anterior temporal sharp wave. Other features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye
movements. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Hyperventilation seems to
accentuate some of the left temporal focal features.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Occasional left temporal focal sharp waves.
2. Occasional paroxysmal slowing, which is bilateral.
CLINICAL CORRELATION This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for
Epilepsy.
