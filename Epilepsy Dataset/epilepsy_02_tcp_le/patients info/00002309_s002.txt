CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed female with previous craniotomy in 1999 for aneurysm, now with episodes of left sided numbness and weakness.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Keppra, Zocor, ASA, Norvasc, HCTZ

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a theta pattern.
Prominent breech rhythm is characterized by an increase in amplitude on the left. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, followed by vertex waves. There is some underlying, subtle focal slowing in the left hemisphere with a bit of underlying temporal, beta, and delta. Arousals, such as that for photic stimulation, are associated less in the way of focal slowing on the left. A scant driving response is noted with accentuation of beta in the left frontal region with photic.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Focal slowing in the left hemisphere.

CLINICAL This patient's Tegretol may contribute to the background slowing described above. No definitive epileptiform features were seen. The focal features were in the region of the patient's previous craniotomy.
