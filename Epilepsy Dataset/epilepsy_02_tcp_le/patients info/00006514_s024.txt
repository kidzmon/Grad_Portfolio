CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old ambidextrous female with refractory epilepsy with left posterior temporal swelling and seizure in the last 24 hours.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Phenobarbital, Metoprolol, Ativan, Protonix, Lovenox, ASA, Plavix, Levothyroxine, Bactrim, Zoloft, Sinemet, Senna


INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is awake, but confused.


DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 6 hertz theta pattern from the right hemisphere. From the left hemisphere, there is movement artifact, but relatively frequent left mid to posterior temporal sharp waves are noted. These are typically seen 5-6 times in a 10 second period and do not demonstrate frequency evolution. There is clear variability in the record. When the patient becomes drowsy, the epileptiform activity is more clearly defined at TS. In wakefulness, there are sections of the record with significantly more theta from the left. Ativan was given during the EEG. The Ativan has the effect of sedating the patient given the sleep state and the appearance of the epileptiform activity which is primarily T5, but sometimes, it is picked up at F7 as well.

HR: 78bpm

IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION This EEG is improved compared to the study this past weekend. The epileptiform activity is congruent with the imaging with more of a posterior temporal focus at this time. No seizures were recorded. Additional on going evaluation was discussed with the clinical team today.
