CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old right handed female with epilepsy admitted following multiple tonic clonic seizures, epilepsy, dementia, down syndrome.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Keppra, Valproic Acid

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient ranges from being drowsy to agitated.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates more a rhythmic theta pattern with bursts of delta, vertex waves. There is a small amount of background beta. There is a small, discreet left frontal sharp wave noted and some triangular shaped bifrontal sharp waves, which may represent a variant of a vertex wave.

HR: 55 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic slowing.
2. Small, discreet left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports the diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. If further characterization of this patient's epileptiform activity is needed, a repeat study when she is a bit more cooperative is suggested. This EEG is not as slow as prior EEGs.
