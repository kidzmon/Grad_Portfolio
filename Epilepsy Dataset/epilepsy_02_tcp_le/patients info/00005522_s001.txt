CLINICAL HISTORY: 83 year old female with a small right occipital infarct, blurred vision, severe headaches and increased confusion.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Fioricet, Ultram, Morphine, Heparin, Nexium, Diovan, Lisinopril, Toprol, Hydralazine, ASA

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: At the start of epoch is a slow background in the theta delta range with an increase in delta activity. The delta is seen at 2 Hz, greater on the left. The delta is also posteriorly predominant. Bursts of FIRDA is seen throughout the record. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slowing of the background, mostly of a delta rhythm, posteriorly dominant and seen greater on the left. á
2. Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity(FIRDA).

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is . no epileptiform activity seen 01) this record. The slowness of the background is non-specific but .w..h the bursts of FIRDA, this is more likely signs of a toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
