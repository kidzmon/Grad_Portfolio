CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old gentleman with metastatic lung cancer in remission for many years, history of hypercoagulable state, past TIA.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Hydroxyurea.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient background EEG demonstrates a well-organized pattern on the right. On the left there is a prominent breech rhythm with accentuation of faster frequency activity and focal slowing characterized primarily by theta and a smaller amount of delta. There is wicket activity. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. Hyperventilation produces an increase in background slowing.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing in the left frontotemporal region.
2. Two T3 sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The breech rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy. The sharp waves on the left support an increased predisposition to seizures. Clinical correlation is suggested.
