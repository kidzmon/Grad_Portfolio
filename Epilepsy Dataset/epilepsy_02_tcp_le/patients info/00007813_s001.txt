CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old male, status post code on May 17, 2011. Multiple cardiac arrests on May 17, 2011. Now intubated and unresponsive. The patient is now in the hypothermia protocol. The patient's body temperature is not at the time of the EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin. Plavix, Demerol, Digoxin, Amiodarone, Lipitor, Famotidine, Zosyn, Captopril, Vancomycin, Zofran, labetalol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This EEG demonstrates an awake pattern in an awake individual who is following commands.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is a 7 Hz alpha rhythm with generous beta activity, lambda waves, a normal phenomenon. are noted in the EEG As the EEG continues the patient is somewhat agitated looking from side to side. here are a handful discrete, T3 sharp waves noted in the EEG.
HR: 72 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A somewhat slow background.
2. Discrete left anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with recurrent cardiac and hypothermia treatment, this EEG suggests a favorable pattern. Additional historical information may be important given the presence of left temporal sharp waves. In addition, a follow up study when the patient is out of the ICU may be important to determine is this a transient or persistent abnormality.
