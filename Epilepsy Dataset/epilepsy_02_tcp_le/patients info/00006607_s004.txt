system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake and easily
confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is disorganized with
excess theta. There is a glimpse of a 7 Hz posterior dominate rhythm. lambda activity
is noted. Occasional bursts of FIRDA are noted.
HR: 120 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
3. Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed today. Although
this is a markedly improved record, the overall background remains quite slow.
