CLINICAL HISTORY:   67-year-old, right handed woman with a history of epilepsy, antiepileptic drug noncompliance and some sort of substance abuse process. The patient is admitted with recurrent seizures, fever, receptive aphasia and ongoing encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation  and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG demonstrates an intrahemispheric asymmetry. The right hemisphere  is at the limits of normal in terms of organization with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a fair amount of background  theta. The left hemisphere demonstrates intermittent  arrhythmic delta, particularly from the temporal region, with a phase reversal in the mid to posterior temporal region. Alerting, for hyperventilation produces a suppression of that focal slowing, but then later on in hyperventilation, the pattern demonstrates some rhythmic bihemispheric slowing. Eye blink artifact is also observed in hyperventilation.
The drowsy pattern is characterized by increase in background  slowing and intermittent
arrhythmic delta which transitions more to a posterior temporal parietal region. Sleep is not sustained. Photic stimulation: Bilateral driving is observed.
HR: 	60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Arrhythmic delta activity in the left hemisphere  with some shifting maximum including mid temporal and in drowsiness  more posterior temporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The sharply contoured slowing is congruent  with this patient's imaging with pathology involving gray and white matter.
