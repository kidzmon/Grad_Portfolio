CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 47-year-old obese woman with a history of epilepsy since her 30s.  Last seizure was in March 2003, with about one or two seizures per year.
MEDICATIONS: Carbatrol and Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric and fairly well organized.  There is a 10 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Occasional right or left irregular temporal delta activity is seen in a background with a lot of eye movement.  Hyperventilation slightly increases the intermittent slowing.  Sleep is evidenced by slow rolling eye movements and vertex waves.  Stage II sleep is characterized by spindles and K complexes.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
HR:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Occasional right or left irregular temporal delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The occasional right or left irregular temporal delta finding is a non-specific pattern, especially in the noisy background with eye movement.  However, no epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is a clinical concern, a repeat EEG may be helpful.
