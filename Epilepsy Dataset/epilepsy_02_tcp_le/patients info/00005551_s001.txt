CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old woman with an acute Ml and chronic history of confusional spells.

MEDICATIONS: ASA. Plavix, lipitor, Metoprolol, Synthroid, Percocet

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 1.0-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed during this record. Hyperventilation was not performed This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG Is appropriately organized in the left hemisphere. The right hemisphere demonstrates intermittent, slow, periodic and somewhat rhythmic sharp waves and sharply contoured slowing. This activity persists as the patient reaches stage 1 and 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles. The data can be reviewed at a very slow paper speed and when it does the slow epileptiform activity demonstrates some waxing and waning occurring in these slow and slow bursts. The rightá frontal electrode, the FP jewel electrode; Is marred throughout much of the record, particularly
when the patient Is awake. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep and does not seem to activate this record. á

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent, sharply contoured, periodic delta or periodic sharp waves in the right hemisphere, particularly in the temporal region often occurring In bursts.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No clinical seizures are not8d. The activity from the left Is relatively unremarkable. The activity on the right suggests a process involving gray and white matter, which is potentially epileptogenic. These findings are somewhat improved compared to
the previous day. á
