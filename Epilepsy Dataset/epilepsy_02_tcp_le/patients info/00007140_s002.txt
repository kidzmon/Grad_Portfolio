EEG REPORT
CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old female, evaluated for seizures vs. non-epileptic seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Protonix, Glipizide. Cyclobenzaprine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is initially somewhat lethargic.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections of the record demonstrate a relatively slow pattern and then a pattern with transition in and out of stage I sleep is noted. Frequent bursts of beta activity are observed. POSTS are noted. Arousals are
associated with an increase in muscle frequency.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features noted. This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which can be seen following the use of sedative hypnotic medications or in postictal state.
