CLINICAL HISTORY:
some form of a brain mass.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:
54 year-old right-handed woman with a possible seizure and
Dilantin, Lotrel, HCTZ, Aldactone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system
of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation
are performed. This is an 1-hour sleep-deprived awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9-Hz posterior dominant
rhythm reaching 30 mV with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta
activity. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread out the posterior dominant
rhythm and an increasing background theta. Other features of drowsiness include
slowing of the background. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. In this 1-hour
EEG there is a small amount of arrhythmic slowing as the patient transitions in and out
of drowsiness. POSTS are observed in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral
driving with harmonic and superharmonic driving.
EEG within normal limits
HR: 60 bpm

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. These
findings may be correlated with clinical history and imaging.
