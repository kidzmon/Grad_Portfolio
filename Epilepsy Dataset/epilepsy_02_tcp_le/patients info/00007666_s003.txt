CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old female, status post code February 7 for 18 minutes. Hospitalized since December 27, 2010, with aortic valve endocarditis, multiple chronic strokes, diffuse cortical injuries, status post code now, evaluate for seizures, and urosepsis.
MEDICATIONS: Glucagon, Insulin, Heparin, Methylprednisolone, Pantoprazole
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is ventilated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD
The overall background is very low voltage,
featureless, and has elements of a discontinuous  pattern with a relatively low voltage, suppressed pattern lasting for 2 to 3 seconds and then bursts of theta.  Reviewing the video, it is not possible to determine if motor activity accompanies the low voltage bursts of mixed theta, delta.  The bursts of mixed theta, delta are typically 1.5 to 2 seconds in duration.  There is some variability in the record in that some sections of the record
have a bit more delta.   Stimulation of the patient does not produce a significant change in the background.
HR: 	96 bpm
IMPRESSION:
Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. 		Replacement of normal background with what is essentially a discontinuous pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These are worrisome findings 11 days post cardiac arrest. There were no clinical seizures. 	If there are additional questions or concerns, additional neurodiagnostic testing may be helpful to more completely evaluate this individual's prognosis and to correlate this with the individual's cerebral function.
