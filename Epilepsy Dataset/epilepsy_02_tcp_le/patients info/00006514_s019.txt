CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old woman with recurrent complex partial status.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Phenobarbital, Keppra, ASA, Metoprolol, HCTZ, Diovan, Plavix, Imdur,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient Is not intubated. She is drowsy. She has occasional titubation of her head.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a pattern of lower voltage theta with repetitive sharp waves from the left hemisphere. They are maximum in the temporal regions, but they have a polyspike component, they wax and wane and build up into brief, clinical seizures with variability. During the epileptiform activity is seen from the left hemisphere. The patient seems to be moving a bit more, and she tends to lift her head a little bit and move her arms. At the close of the record, the patient's seizures continue.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
