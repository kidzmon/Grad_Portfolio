CLINICAL HISTORY: 83 year old female with a small right· occipital infarct, blurred
Vision severe headaches and increased confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Fioricet, Ultram, Morphine, Heparin, Nexium, Diovan,
Toprol, Hydralazine, ASA
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: AI !tie start of epoch is a slow background in the theta delta range with an increase in delta activity. The delta is seen at 2 Hz, greater on
the left. The delta is also posteriorly predominant. Bursts of FIRDA is seen throughout
the record. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:. 6O bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slowing of the background, mostly of a delta rhythm, posteriorly dominant and seen greater on the left.
2. Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity(FIRDA).
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity seen on this record. The
slowness of the background is non-specific but .
with the bursts of FIRDA: this is more likely signs of a toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
