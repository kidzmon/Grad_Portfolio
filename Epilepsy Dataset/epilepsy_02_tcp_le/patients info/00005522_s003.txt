CLINICAL HISTORY: 84 year old right handed woman with acute change in mental status, past history of intracerebral hemorrhage, right carotid endarterectomy in 2003 and cardiac stents.

MEDICATIONS: None.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG monitoring this is an awake and asleep record. Photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized with a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 7 Hz. In the transition to sleep, there is shifting arrhythmic delta activity and on some occasions a more of a rhythmic theta pattern with more delta activity on the right compared to the left. There is a single left anterior temporal sharp wave noted in drowsiness. The patient is asleep during photic stimulation.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity a bit more so on the right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Only a single sharp wave was observed in the record. The findings described above are nonspecific but of note the patient does seem to be excessively drowsy.
