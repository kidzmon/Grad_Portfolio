CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old male, status post code on 1/27/2011, anoxic
encephalopathy, delirium.
MEDICATIONS: Propofol, Versed, Tramadol, Xanax, Cefepime
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively immobile
with a tracheostomy. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall EEG demonstrates a low voltage
pattern with intermittent rhythmic 4 Hz activity in the frontal regions. The technologist
notes that there is eye movement artifact. Stimulation of the patient does not activate
the record. The technologist holds the patient's eyes closed to help differentiate
between eye artifact and frontal cerebral activity. While there is some eye movement
artifact, there does appear to be some frontal, â•–cerebral activity.
HR; 104bpm
Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Markedly suppressed background. .
2. Occasional bursts of frontally prominent 4 Hz activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe, underlying encephalopathy.
No seizures were recorded. If additional information is needed, a followup study using a
neuromuscular blocking agent might be of value. Previous EEGs were not available.
