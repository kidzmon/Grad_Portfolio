CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old woman admitted with an episode of shaking, facial twitching lasting 2 minutes on the morning on January 13, 2009. She has a past history of stroke, diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy, HIV, and baseline right hemiparesis.
MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Dilantin, Aspirin, Plavix.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation was performed. The is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. The overall background is reasonably well organized and relatively high amplitude. There is a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. As the recording continues, the alpha rhythm increases in frequency, reaching 10Hz. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Modest background slowing seen in the initial portion of the record, later resolving.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. The findings of transient slowing in the initial record are compatible with a postictal process. If epilepsy is an important consideration, additional EEG recording is advised.
